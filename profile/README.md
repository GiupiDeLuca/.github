IoTeX was founded as an open-source platform in 2017 with a vision for the Internet of Trusted Things, a decentralized ecosystem where humans and machines can interact with guaranteed security and trust. We are on a mission to ensure everyday people and businesses can own and control their devices, as well as the data/value they generate. By connecting the physical and digital worlds, IoTeX will democratize access to machine-backed DApps, assets, and services to deliver value to users and fuel the new machine economy.

## What IoTeX Can Help You Achieve
- Create Next Generation Dapps to Change the World.
- Tokenize Real-World Objects, Facts, and Events.
