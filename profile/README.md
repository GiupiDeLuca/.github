## Intro
[IoTeX](https://iotex.io/) was founded as decentralized, open-source platform in 2017 to power a new set of applications based on real world data. By connecting the physical and the digital worlds, IoTeX aims to deliver the foundational layer for DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) applications to flourish and revolutionaize web3. 
Feel free to browse through or head over to the [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/) and start building DePIN applications now:
